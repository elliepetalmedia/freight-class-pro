Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer. Build a complete, production-ready, client-side application called "FreightClassPro".

1. FILE STRUCTURE
Create the following files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /pages/about.html
- /pages/contact.html
- /pages/privacy.html

2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
- Persistence: Use `localStorage` to save the "Unit Preference" (Inches/CM) and last input values.
- Constraint: No backend. All calculations happen in the browser.

3. DESIGN SYSTEM (style.css)
- Theme: "Industrial Logistics".
- Colors: Background #0f172a (Dark Slate), Panel #1e293b, Border #334155, Accent #f59e0b (Safety Orange), Text #f1f5f9.
- Typography: 'Roboto' (UI) and 'Roboto Mono' (Numbers).
- Components:
  - Calculator Card: High contrast, large input fields for warehouse visibility.
  - Result Box: Prominent display of "Density" and "Class".
  - Reference Table: A styled HTML table showing the Density-to-Class mapping.

4. APPLICATION LOGIC (script.js)
- Inputs:
  - Dimensions: Length, Width, Height.
  - Weight.
  - Selectors: Units (Inches/Lbs vs CM/Kg), Palletized (Boolean toggle).
- Logic:
  1. Convert inputs to Imperial for calculation (CM -> Inches, Kg -> Lbs).
  2. Calculate Volume (Cubic Feet): (L * W * H) / 1728.
  3. Calculate Density (PCF - Pounds per Cubic Foot): Weight / Volume.
  4. Determine Class based on Standard NMFC Density Guidelines:
     - Density < 1: Class 400
     - 1 <= Density < 2: Class 300
     - 2 <= Density < 4: Class 250
     - 4 <= Density < 6: Class 150
     - 6 <= Density < 8: Class 125
     - 8 <= Density < 10: Class 100
     - 10 <= Density < 12: Class 92.5
     - 12 <= Density < 15: Class 85
     - 15 <= Density < 22.5: Class 70
     - 22.5 <= Density < 30: Class 65
     - 30 <= Density < 35: Class 60
     - Density >= 35: Class 50
- Output: Update DOM with calculated Density (2 decimal places) and Class.

5. INDEX.HTML CONTENT
- Header: Logo "FreightClassPro", Subtitle "LTL Density Calculator".
- Disclaimer: Below the calculator, add small text: "Data Source: Based on standard guidelines from the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) and Commodity Classification Standards Board (CCSB)."
- Main Layout: Two columns. Left: Calculator. Right: The Reference Table of classes.
- SEO Article: Below the app, insert an `<article>` with this EXACT HTML:

    <h2 style="color: #f1f5f9;">Understanding Freight Classes (NMFC)</h2>
    <p>In the LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) shipping industry, the cost of shipping is determined by the "Freight Class." This classification system was developed by the National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) to establish fair pricing based on the transportability of goods.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9;">How Density Impacts Price</h3>
    <p>The lower the density of your shipment, the higher the Freight Class (and the higher the cost). For example, ping pong balls take up a lot of space but weigh very little (Class 500), whereas steel bolts are extremely heavy and compact (Class 50).</p>

    <h3 style="color: #f1f5f9;">Avoiding Re-Classification Fees</h3>
    <p>Carriers frequently re-weigh and re-measure pallets at terminals. If your Bill of Lading (BOL) lists an incorrect class (e.g., you guessed Class 70 but it's actually Class 100), the carrier will issue a "Re-Class Fee" adjustment. Using an accurate density calculator protects your profit margins.</p>
